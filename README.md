# Virtual Network Lab

Network Security | Access Control | Intrusion Detection | Firewall Configuration | Identity and Access Management (IAM) | Network Hardening | Active Directory | Virtual Lab

## Objective

This project aims to build a secure, virtualized network environment demonstrating essential network architecture, cybersecurity, and access control skills. By simulating a real-world network setup, this project showcases proficiency in deploying firewall rules, managing user access through Identity and Access Management (IAM), and implementing network hardening techniques to protect against potential threats.

This project aims to illustrate practical experience in creating and managing a secure, adaptable network that meets the security and accessibility needs expected in a professional IT environment.

### Key Features

- Network Security and Monitoring: Configure incoming and outgoing firewall rules, set up continuous traffic monitoring, and implement intrusion detection to ensure robust protection of network assets.
- Active Directory Integration: Set up Identity and Access Management (IAM) through Active Directory, including user and group management, strong password policies, and permissions for secure resource access.
- File Sharing and Public Resources: Enable file-sharing capabilities (e.g., SMB or NAS) and securely host public-facing resources in a DMZ, balancing accessibility and security as guided by the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
- Platform Flexibility: Lab creation will emulate real-world Cisco Packet Tracer solutions.

### Skills Learned

- Planning and deploying a network architecture

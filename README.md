## Objective

This project illustrates the design and deployment of a secure, virtualized network lab that replicates the cybersecurity standards commonly expected in a professional environment. By implementing strong security protocols, this lab setup will demonstrate expertise in network hardening, access control, and traffic monitoring.

### Key Features

- Network Security and Monitoring: Configure incoming and outgoing firewall rules, set up continuous traffic monitoring, and implement intrusion detection to ensure robust protection of network assets.
- Active Directory Integration: Set up Identity and Access Management (IAM) through Active Directory, including user and group management, strong password policies, and permissions for secure resource access.
- File Sharing and Public Resources: Enable file-sharing capabilities (e.g., SMB or NAS) and securely host public-facing resources in a DMZ, balancing accessibility and security as guided by the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
- Platform Flexibility: Lab creation will emulate real-world Cisco Packet Tracer solutions.

### Skills Learned

- Planning and deploying a network architecture 
- Traffic monitoring 
- Establishing firewall rules 
- Setting up and managing IAM (Identity and Access Management), including users and groups in Active Directory 
- Network hardening techniques

### Tools Used

- Active Directory
- Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation
- Wireshark for traffic analysis
- pfSense as a firewall
- Snort for intrusion detection
- PowerShell for scripting and automation
